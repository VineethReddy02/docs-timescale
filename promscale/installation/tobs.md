# Tobs - The Observability Stack for Kubernetes

Tobs is a tool that aims to make it as easy as possible to install a full observability
stack into a Kubernetes cluster. Currently this stack includes:

<img src="<UPLOAD_TOBS_IMAGE_TO_S3_AND_REFER_IT_HERE>" alt="Tobs Architecture Diagram" width="800"/>

 * [Kube-Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus#kube-prometheus) the Kubernetes monitoring stack
    * [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) to collect metrics
    * [AlertManager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager#alertmanager-) to fire the alerts
    * [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) to visualize what's going on
    * [Node-Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) to export metrics from the nodes
    * [Kube-State-Metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) to get metrics from kubernetes api-server
    * [Prometheus-Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator#prometheus-operator) to manage the life-cycle of Prometheus and AlertManager custom resource definitions (CRDs)
 * [Promscale](https://github.com/timescale/promscale) ([design doc][design-doc]) to store metrics for the long-term and allow analysis with both PromQL and SQL.
 * [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) for long term storage of metrics and provides ability to query metrics data using SQL. 
 * [Promlens](https://promlens.com/) tool to build and analyse promql queries with ease.
 * [Opentelemetry-Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator#opentelemetry-operator-for-kubernetes) to manage the lifecycle of OpenTelemetryCollector Custom Resource Definition (CRDs)
 * [Jaeger Query](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) to visualise the traces 
 
We plan to expand this stack over time and welcome contributions.

Tobs provides a CLI tool to make deployment and operations easier. We also provide
Helm charts that can be used directly or as sub-charts for other projects.

## ðŸ”¥ Quick start

### Installing the CLI tool

To download and install tobs, run the following in your terminal, then follow the on-screen instructions.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLf  https://tsdb.co/install-tobs-sh |sh
```

Alternatively, you can download the CLI directly via [our releases page](https://github.com/timescale/tobs/releases/latest)

Getting started with the CLI tool is a two-step process: First you install the CLI tool locally, then you use the CLI tool to install the tobs stack into your Kubernetes cluster.

### Using the tobs CLI tool to deploy the stack into your Kubernetes cluster

After setting up tobs run the following to install the tobs helm charts into your Kubernetes cluster

```bash
tobs install
```

This will deploy all of the tobs components into your cluster and provide instructions as to next steps.

#### Tracing support

From `0.7.0` release tobs supports installation of tracing components. To install tracing components use 
```
tobs install --tracing
```
For more details on tracing support visit [Promscale tracing docs](https://github.com/timescale/promscale/blob/master/docs/tracing.md).

### Using the tobs CLI tool

The [usage guide][tobs-cli-usage-guide] for CLI tool on tobs github repo provides the most seamless experience for interacting with tobs.

## Configuring the stack

All configuration for all components happens through the helm values.yml file.
You can view the self-documenting [default values.yaml][tobs-helm-values] in the tobs repo.
We also have additional documentation about individual configuration settings in our
[Helm chart docs][[tobs-helm-values-config-details]].

To modify the settings, first create a values.yaml file:
```bash
tobs helm show-values > values.yaml
```

Then modify the values.yaml file using your favorite editor.
Finally, deploy with the new settings using:
```bash
tobs install -f values.yaml
```

## ðŸ›  Using the Tobs Helm chart without the CLI tool [](tobs-helm-installation)

Users sometimes want to use our Helm charts as sub-charts for other project or integrate them into their infrastructure without using our CLI tool. Below are instruction to install tobs using helm chart.

### Installing the helm chart

The following command will install Kube-Prometheus, TimescaleDB, and Promscale
into your Kubernetes cluster:
```
helm repo add timescale https://charts.timescale.com/
helm repo update
helm install <release_name> timescale/tobs
```

**Note**: To customise the tobs helm chart installtion you can use tobs [values.yaml][tobs-helm-values] with your desired changes. 

## Compatibility matrix

## Tobs vs. Kubernetes

| Tobs     | Kubernetes           |
|----------|----------------------|
| 0.7.0    | v1.19 to v1.21       | 


### Next Steps
Congratulations, you've successfully deployed the observability stack using tobs. You can explore your data by connecting to your TimescaleDB instance and visualise data using Grafana.
